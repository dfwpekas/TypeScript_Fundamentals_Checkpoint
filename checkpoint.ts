// 1 // Define an interface named Vehicle with the following properties:
// // make of type string
// // model of type string
// // year of type number
// // start method which returns void and logs "Engine started" to the console.

interface Vehicle {
    make: string,
    model: string,
    year: number,

// 2  // Implement a class named Car that implements the Vehicle interface. The Car class should have:
// A constructor that initializes the make, model, and year properties.
// Implement the start method to log "Car engine started" to the console.

class Car implements Vehicle {

// 3 Create an instance of the Car class and initialize it with some values for make, model, and year.

const newCar = new Car('Mercedes-Benz', 'S-Class', 2023)

// 4 Call the start method on the instance of the Car class.

newCar.start() // Engine Started
